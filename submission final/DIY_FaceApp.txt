I implemented the GAN on CIFAR dataset.
Ran it for 10k epochs.

I/p image dimensions - (32 * 32 * 3)
There are 60k images in CIFAR10 dataset and 10 classes.
Latent dimension = (1 * 100)
This is the noise that we give as input to the generator
learning of Activation function (LeakyReLU) - 0.2
momentum - 0.8
Optimizer - Adam
